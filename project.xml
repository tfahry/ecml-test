<projekt comment="Before Stitching into the NIM the Interlocking changes detailed below will need to be completed in the model being stitched&#xA;&#xA;The names and IDs Interlockings have been amended so that &#xA;(75mph - 100mph) is now (76mph - 100mph),&#xA;(Over 100mph) is now (101mph - 125mph),&#xA;(101mph to 125mph) is now  (101mph - 125mph), and the name has been changed of&#xA;AB stop (3 aspect) to AB Stop (3 aspect),&#xA;AB stop (4 aspect) to AB Stop (4 aspect),&#xA;this is all to minimise confusion.&#xA;&#xA;There are two interlocking types for all interlockings with Partial Release. There is the 'standard' name e.g. Shunt, and a 'Point Release' name e.g. Points Shunt. This is to allow for modelling to be done using both release contacts, where present, and use the setting to partially release track 40m after sets of points where release contacts are not included. &#xA;These two options are present, however all signals are currently defaulted to the 'release at release contacts option' and will not otherwise release.&#xA;&#xA;" makroProject="false" editor="Alec Howe" description="NIM 2018 02 14" date="2018-02-22">
